**TL;DR:** nostr[^fn-nostr] is a protocol that has the power to replace twitter,
Instagram, and all the other data silos that force various feeds down our
collective throats.

[^fn-nostr]: nostr = Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays

nostr is new and confusing but also really cool. It is **the simplest open protocol that is able to create a
censorship-resistant global "social" network** once and for all.

- It doesn't rely on any trusted central server, hence it is resilient.
- It is based on cryptographic keys and signatures, so it is tamperproof.
- It does not rely on P2P techniques, therefore it works.

It is free as in freedom and puts the user in control.

# FAQ

**What's the easiest way to create a profile?**
🦚 Going to [nstart.me](https://nstart.me/) is probably easiest. The wizard will walk you through every step.
There is also [nosta.me](https://nosta.me/), which introduces relays and other nostr activities.

**What is the best nostr client?**
🦚 There is no best. You'll have to [pick a client](#clients) according to your
tastes!

**What is the second best nostr client?**
🦚 This question is best answered by watching [this video](https://youtu.be/uDgnZn3SjLw).

**Is nostr just a twitter clone?**
🦚 No, it's way more than that. I'd suggest you browse
[nostrapps.com](https://nostrapps.com/) and try one of the more adventurous apps
yourself!

**Where do I store my "nsec" aka private key?**
🦚 Make sure read the [key management](#keys) section!

**What is an "npub"?**
🦚 Your "npub", or nostr public key, is your public identity. It is unique to
you and can be used to look up your profile and initiate a connection with you,
either via a follow, a DM, or a zap.

**What are zaps?**
🦚 Zaps are nostr's way of seamlessly transferring value between users. They are
neither "tips" nor "expensive likes," but a new way of expressing value and
counterfeit-resistant engagement. They are [sat-based][br] [tokens of appreciation](https://njump.me/nevent1qvzqqqqqqypzqmjxss3dld622uu8q25gywum9qtg4w4cv4064jmg20xsac2aam5nqy2hwumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hj7qgwwaehxw309ahx7uewd3hkctcqyqx6hc4glxnhergs086yp77ne8cdt8zt5z99r4lcz88whfvtq23920ynxd7) with
perfect scarcity. They are, as one nostrich so beautifully put it, a way to say:
[keep doing you][kdy]. Zaps are flowing through the system at all times, as you
can clearly see via [zaplife.lol](https://zaplife.lol).

[br]: https://bitcoin-resources.com/
[kdy]: https://coracle.social/nevent1qqs2f66rxmq5xdcpfc4mdzded083zse8qy2mnqkayyvtzruknqmuf3gzyphydppzm7m554ecwq4gsgaek2qk32atse2l4t9ks57dpms4mmhfxaaw0q4

**How do I set up my client properly?**
🦚 Check out these guides:

- [Guide for Damus](https://nostr.how/guides/damus) (iOS)
- [Guide for Amethyst](https://nostr.how/guides/amethyst) (Android)
- [Guide for Iris](https://nostr.how/guides/iris) (Web)

**What are relays, and how do I find them?**
🦚 Read the [relays](#relays) section.

**Are all nostr apps available on the App Store?**
🦚 They are not. The existing monopolies are threatened by nostr and what it
represents. But fear not, we will build our own app stores. We have one on
Android already: [Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/), an app store built on
nostr.

**Where do I find alternatives to existing stuff?**
🦚 Have a look at [noalt.app](http://noalt.app/)

**How do I find people to follow?**
🦚 Use various [search](#search) tools, browse [trending
notes](https://trending.relays.land/), or check out [Following._](https://following.space/) for convenient, user-curated packs of suggested follows.
You can follow topical hashtags like
[#introductions](https://nosey.vercel.app/?q=%23introductions), too. Yes, on nostr you can
follow hashtags. You can also visit [Npub.world](https://npub.world/) to search for
a specific person. Find your X/twitter friends by using this seach query: - [🔎 "verifying my account on nostr" (ppl you follow)](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22verifying%20my%20account%20on%20nostr%22&f=live&pf=1). This uses the [nostr.directory](https://www.nostr.directory/) verification
message, but the `&pf=1` limits the twitter search to only people you follow.


**I have more questions. Who can help me?**
🦚 Consult this [external FAQ](https://uselessshit.co/resources/nostr/), [asknostr](https://asknostr.site/) or use the
[#asknostr](https://nosey.vercel.app/?q=%23asknostr) hashtag in a note from any client.

# Learn More

nostr's design is very basic:

- There are two components: **clients** and **relays**. Each user runs a client. Anyone can run a relay.
- Every user is identified by a public key. Every post is signed. Every client validates these signatures.
- Clients fetch data from relays of their choice and publish data to other relays of their choice. A relay doesn't talk to another relay, only directly to users.

To use nostr, you need a [key](#keys) and a [client](#clients).

- Everybody runs a client. It can be a native client, a web client, etc.
- To publish something, you write a post, sign it with your key and send it to multiple relays (servers hosted by someone else, or yourself).
- To get updates from other people, you ask multiple relays if they know anything about these other people.
- Anyone can run a relay. A relay is very simple. It does nothing besides accepting posts from some people and forwarding to others.
- Relays don't have to be trusted. Signatures are verified on the client side.

## Keys

Your keys are your identity. You can think of your public key (`npub...`) as
your username and your private key (`nsec...`) as your password.

Two quick things:

- ⚠️ **DO NOT PASTE YOUR PRIVATE KEY INTO WEBSITES**[^fn-xss] ⚠️
- Store your keys securely and do not share your private key


Keys exist in two formats, `hex` and the above mentioned npub/nsec. You can use
a [key converter tool](https://github.com/rot13maxi/key-convertr)[^fn-keys] to
convert between the two formats.

[^fn-keys]: There's also the [damus.io/key](https://damus.io/key/) but DO NOT use it for private key conversions. Don't paste your private key into websites. Just don't.

[^fn-xss]: You have to trust whoever is running the website, obviously, and some clients are vulnerable to XSS attacks. A lot of people got rekt already, and had to re-build their nostr identity because of it.

Use [Alby](https://getalby.com) or [nos2x](https://github.com/fiatjaf/nos2x) to
generate your keys, or generate them using a dedicated tool like
[rana](https://github.com/grunch/rana). The aforementioned extensions will
store your keys safely (or at least more safely). Check out [this list](https://spatianostra.com/a-simple-list-of-nostr-signers/) for a sampling of key management tools.

- [Nostr in the Alby Extension](https://blog.getalby.com/nostr-in-the-alby-extension/)
- [The nos2x browser extension and why you should use it](https://youtu.be/IoLw-3ok3_M)

If you're on mobile, it is recommended to use a native signer like [Amber] on Android or
[Nostash] on iOS.

[Amber]: https://github.com/greenart7c3/Amber?tab=readme-ov-file#download-and-install
[Nostash]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nostash/id6744309333

You can also generate your keys by other means if you know what you're doing.[^bip85]
It's still early days, so be prepared to get rekt.

[^bip85]: [BIP-85](https://bip85.com/) is an option, for example.

## Relays

Relays are simple servers that you can leave behind at any time ([so they can't
turn evil](https://youtu.be/5FbgDUQjziM)). You need to connect your client to a relay for it to work. There are
many relays & you can run your own. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/TFH7Xr0cJ0w) for a quick tutorial on managing relays.

- [nostr.watch](http://nostr.watch/) - directory of paid and free relays
- [nostr.info](https://nostr.info/relays/) directory of known nostr relays
- [relay.tools](https://relay.tools/) - public relay browser

Run your own:

- [Set up a Nostr Relay server in under 5 minutes](https://andreneves.xyz/p/set-up-a-nostr-relay-server-in-under)[^fn-fork]
- Run a native, personal relay on Android with [Citrine](https://github.com/greenart7c3/Citrine?tab=readme-ov-file#download)
- Install [nostr-relay-tray](https://github.com/CodyTseng/nostr-relay-tray/releases) for a simple, local relay on your desktop.
- Easily host a powerful community relay with many features, on a cheap VPS with [Pyramid](https://github.com/fiatjaf/pyramid)

Paid relays:

Paid relays effectively deal with spam by charging users a small usage fee in
sats. You can set your global feed to paid relays only, which will get rid of
almost all spam.

[^fn-fork]: Fork with small modifications/fixes: [Install a nostr relay](https://www.massmux.com/install-a-nostr-relay/)

Unique relays:

Relays can also act as [content curators](https://youtu.be/CL34LnBs0OQ), unlock different ways of interacting, be the home of communities or groups, and more.
See an example of a human-curated feed [here](https://jumble.social/?r=relays.land/spatianostra).

## Tips & Tricks

Some things work a bit differently and aren't always obvious, such as:

- [Posting images](#posting-images)
- [Nostr Address](#nostr-addresses)
- [Receiving Zaps](#receiving-zaps)

### Posting images

Many popular clients support image uploads directly. (Keep in mind that all
uploaded images to external hosts are public, so don't upload confidential
things willy-nilly.)

Most clients will display image URLs as images, so you can just upload any image
to image sharing sites and post the URL like this:

```
https://i.ibb.co/w4WvnYb/image.png
```

This also works for videos.

Here are some free image hosts:

- [nostr.build](https://nostr.build/)
- [imgbb.com](https://imgbb.com/)
- [imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- [postimages.org](https://postimages.org/)
- [nostrcheck.me](https://nostrcheck.me/public/)

[Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) uses nostr to decentralize media hosting.
If your favorite social client offers blossom support, check out [blossomservers.com](https://blossomservers.com/)
to find a list of rated and reviewed blossom servers.

If you still have an X/twitter account, you can attach your profile picture to your nostr profile
by [following this guide](https://medium.com/@_Bosch_/how-to-use-your-twitter-display-picture-on-nostr-fd43c6a26257).

### Nostr Addresses

Having a nostr address (aka NIP-05) can make it easier for people to find your profile, associate you
with a business or organization, help to guard against impersonation, or provide access to members-only areas.

If you have a domain and want to host your own address, here is some
useful info:

- [NVK's guide (using Github Pages)](https://nvk.org/n00b-nip5)
- [metasikander's guide (generic)](https://gist.github.com/metasikander/609a538e6a03b2f67e5c8de625baed3e)

There are also centralized nostr address providers that you can use. Paid providers often offer other
services alongside of address hosting. Be aware that all these _are_ centralized and that they can rug-pull
you at any moment:

{{< nip05providers "free" >}}

Paid services:

{{< nip05providers "paid" >}}

Provider missing? Price changed? \
Please [create a PR](https://github.com/nostr-resources/nostr-resources-v2/blob/main/data/nip05providers.yaml) or [open an issue](https://github.com/nostr-resources/nostr-resources-v2/issues) to fix it!

### Receiving Zaps

Zaps are [V4V](https://value4value.info/) lightning payments that are broadcast
as nostr events, so that clients can display them on user profiles and specific
notes.

To receive zaps you need a lightning wallet that supports
[NIP-57](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/57.md).

Popular custodial solutions are:

- [Wallet of Satoshi](https://walletofsatoshi.com/) - recommended for mobile (not available everywhere)
- [Coinos](https://coinos.io/) - a web wallet with Nostr Wallet Connect capabilities
- [Primal](https://primal.net/home) - nostr client with built-in Bitcoin wallet for iOS, Android, and web
- [Rizful](https://rizful.com/) - easy to use Nostr Wallet Connect capable lightning wallet

The Cashu protocol is bringing bitcoin-backed ecash to custodial Nostr zaps and beyond. It is still quite new (aka experimental). You can read more about it [here](https://cashu.space/). A couple of nice wallets to try are:

- [Minibits](https://www.minibits.cash/) - Android native
- [Cashu.me](https://wallet.cashu.me/welcome) - PWA for iOS and Android
- [Macadamia](https://macadamia.cash/) - iOS native

You can find ecash mints and read reviews at [bitcoinmints.com](https://bitcoinmints.com/?tab=mints).

Self-custodial solutions:
- [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/)
- [Alby Hub](https://blog.getalby.com/what-is-alby-hub/)

### Mentions & Deep Links

You can mention a note or a user by putting an "@" before an _npub_ or _note_ like this:

- `@npub1dergggklka99wwrs92yz8wdjs952h2ux2ha2ed598ngwu9w7a6fsh9xzpc`
- `@note1m2ev3e2ma7a84rr8053qhsggeg6apmp00445v8k7tyeqvhu5u8aqpc30sp`

When mentioning a note in another note, the note will be shown as a quote-note.[^fn-quotenote]

Most clients support the `nostr:` URL scheme as defined in
[NIP-21](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/21.md), which means
you can link to your nostr profile by putting "nostr:" in front of your npub.
This will result in a link that opens in the user's nostr client, like
so: [open my nostr
profile](nostr:npub1dergggklka99wwrs92yz8wdjs952h2ux2ha2ed598ngwu9w7a6fsh9xzpc).

You can use this for http redirects too, which can be used as a way to verify your nostr profile if you own a domain, like so: [dergigi.com/npub](https://dergigi.com/npub)

There is even a [redirect tool](https://nostredirect.davidcoen.it/) that you can use; h/t to [David](nostr:npub149mp2m0q8prpdys7x2lusv2vceraxwzr4ajf6tv3l24my3gtszxsncas0t) for putting it together.

[^fn-quotenote]: How's that for a tongue twister?
